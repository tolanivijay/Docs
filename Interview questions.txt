Deutche:

1)MV,updating views
2)How can we use 2 stacks and convert into a queue
3)nth highest marks
4)clustered and non-clustered index
5)class diagram for Decorator pattern
6)Design principles
7)CopyonWriteArrayList

Amdocs written test:
1) Write a program for ATM notes retrival system which takes of below
   a) It always ensures the least number of notes disbursed based on amount
   b) Handle concurrency
   c) It sends information regarding the denomiation and no of notes(for e.g 500*1+100*2 = 700)
   
2) What is the use of version in Hibernate/JPA. Give example
3) Given a connectionPool class ,extend the class to give info if there is any connectionLeak
4) static method of collection which takes a Collection and returns a SyncCollection.How would u implement
   such a thing ?

1) How to avoid data race without locking ?
2) How to programatically detect deadlock ?
3) What is optimistic and passimistic locking ?
4) Considering a Map of String vs Integer,where Integer is updated a good number of times,
   how would u design to fetch best performance.

Numora (Round 1)

1) Considering there can be n number of multiple requests on a servlet, will this not cause an issue ?
    for e.g. 100000 simultaneous requests can cause issues,how can we control it ?
2) 



(Round 2)
1) On a 32 bit JVM, how will you deal with OutofMemoryError.
   i.e. if you face OfMError, what we do about it ? How much RAM would you increase ?
   have you ever seen GC Logs to check memory ?
2) Questions around immutable class.
3) If a response is around 500 MB, how would u design an application if there are 
   10 simultaneous requests on the same node.
   We need to even consider all 10 requests should not suffer time lag.Once again
   consider 32 bit JVM.
4) What do you prefer is a better response structure xml or json? 
5) Explan Java GC
