Apache Kafka can be understood as a distrubted messaging which should be used where the amount of data is humungoues 
and is beyond the capacity of traditional messaging like queue or topic.

If traditional messaging each queue or topic is hosted on a given server and the same server or broker takes all the load.
If the amount of data is huge, the very same broker has to deal with all the producers and consumers.
Clearly the above model does not allow for horizontal scaling and nothing much can be done if the load increases.

The answer to above limitation is Apache kafka which can be considered as a distrubted messaging which we can scale
horizontally (i.e. increasing new nodes as needed).


Nodes, Partitions and Topics:
1) Topic is the same concept that we have in traditional messaging i.e. if the same message has to be supplied to multiple consumers,
   topic is used
1) Node : Node can be termed as a physical server or box which is participating as a server
2) Parti
