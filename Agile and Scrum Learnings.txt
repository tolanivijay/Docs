------------------------------ Problem with Traditional Waterfall approach ----------------------------

Move on to next phase only when current phase is completely done.
Deliever the complete software as 1 chunk.
Feedback from users can be taken only when the complete development is completed
and if they dont like anything or any other changes, it becomes all that diffucult to achieve.

So if a software takes around 3 months of development and it was not accepted all the
time is completly throw away.

----------------------------- Basics of Agile --------------------------------------------

Divide your delievery into smaller logical features and deliever and take feedback,
as feedback on a live running system is much more meaningful and relevant than otherwise.
Each smaller delievery is called 'Sprint' which is typically 2-3 weeks each.
Above divide and conquer approach also helps to manage risks better, and gives you more
chance if the requirement changes after feedback.



------------------------------ Scrum Basics ----------------------------------------------
Scrum can be defined as 'Get-together', where each participant on a team including 
developers,Project Owner and other parties involve and discuss progress and challenges.
This enables more transperency and accountability as each and every member of your team
exactly knows what others are doing.

Scrum Master : Normally a Tech Lead or Mentor takes this position and he drives the scrum call.

Project Owner : He is normally like a business analyst who is hands on with the business requirement
and moniters health of the project.
